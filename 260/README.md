### `CPTS_260/` â€“ Computer Architecture & Assembly Programming

This folder contains all of my assignments, labs, and projects from **CPTS 260 at WSU**, which focused on **computer architecture** and programming in **assembly language**. The course covered fundamental concepts of how computers process instructions and how to write low-level programs for different architectures, including **x86 MIPS**.

Assignments were partially provided by the professor, and my task was to complete the code in assembly, gaining hands-on experience with **instruction sets**, **registers**, **memory management**, and **CPU architecture**.
