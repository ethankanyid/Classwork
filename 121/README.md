### `CPTS_121/` â€“ Program Design and Development in C

This folder contains all of my assignments, labs, and projects from **CPTS 121 at WSU**, which focused on coding in **C**, working with memory, and understanding program structure and logic.

**Also**: A few small **HTML** docs are included in this folder as side exercises.
