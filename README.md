# Classwork Repository

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my programming class assignments, notes, and practice projects. It's a record of my progress as I learn to code, improve my problem-solving skills, and explore different areas of computer science.

## About This Repository

This repo contains organized folders for each class session or topic I've covered, with relevant code and notes.

### My Coursework Focused On:

-  **Systems Programming** – Writing low-level code in C and C++, mastering memory management, file systems, and working close to the OS  
-  **Computer Architecture & Assembly** – Gaining experience with registers, stack frames, memory addressing, and writing programs in x86 Assembly  
-  **Cybersecurity** – Exploring vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, SQL injection, and XSS
-  **Cryptography** – Topics include encryption (symmetric/asymmetric), hash functions, digital signatures, PKI, and implementing classical ciphers
-  **Quantum Cryptography** – Concepts of Entanglement and Superposition applied to protocols like BB84 and E91
-  **Functional Programming** – Learning the principles of functional languages through Lisp and Standard ML, including recursion, immutability, and higher-order functions  
-  **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Implementing classic structures (linked lists, trees, stacks, queues), and learning sorting, searching, and complexity analysis  
-  **Automata Theory & Turing Machines** – Studying finite automata, regular expressions, and simulating Turing machines to understand the limits of computation  

### My Coding Language Experience Includes:

- **C & C++** – My primary languages; used for systems-level work, memory management, and performance-critical tasks  
- **Assembly (MIPSx86)** – Low-level understanding of registers, memory layout, and calling conventions  
- **Standard ML & Lisp** – Functional programming concepts, recursion, and symbolic computation
- **Python** – For scripting, automation, and quick prototyping  
- **Bash / Shell Scripting** – For automation and working with the Unix/Linux environment  

#### Tools & Environments
- `gdb`, `valgrind`, `make`, `gcc`
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Linux command line and scripting
- Zed, VS Code, remote development
