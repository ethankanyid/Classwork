Q2:
SIP: SIP sets up, manages, and ends multimedia communication sessions like voice or video calls over IP networks.
RTP: RTP carries real-time audio and video data across IP networks once a session is established.
MP4/ALC/LCT: These protocols support adaptive and scalable media delivery, allowing efficient transmission of layered audio and video streams.
BitTorrent: BitTorrent enables peer-to-peer file sharing by letting users download and upload pieces of files directly between computers.

Q3:
1.
MP4 streaming uses small segments of video sent over the network instead of one continuous stream.

udp

In Wireshark captures, you can see MP4 “boxes” like ftyp, styp, and sidx inside the packet data.
ftyp shows file type information for initialization.
styp marks the start and type of a segment.
sidx includes index and timing details.
2.
These packets mostly contain setup and timing information, not the actual video content.

Unlike a continuous RTP stream, fragmented MP4 is sent in small pieces that can be managed separately.
3.
Sending short fragments makes it easier to adjust video quality for different network speeds and to broadcast the same content to many users at once.

Q4:
bittorrent is p2p and typically uses tcp but occasionaly uses udp as well
