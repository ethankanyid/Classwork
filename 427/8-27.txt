Q1: it allows you to break apart the different aspects of communication that may be different across systems
and create an encapsulated approach that is standardly recognized across the internet.
each layer is able to use its own method to create secure, consistent,
and available communication. it also gives abstraction so that you dont have to have a unique communication
for every app or service, you can just use a unique layer instead of recreating a new method each time
