Q1:
distributed systems are machines that are distributed potentially across regions that work together to solve problems. users can spread their computing across the systems.

Q2:
a centralized system is where all computing happens from a central point of command and if this point goes down, then the system is down

Q3:
middlware acts as a bridge between different systems and processes and allows for more fluent IPC between systems. it acts between a client and server so that the user doesnt have to directly interface with the system

Q4:
a) Resource sharing - system shares cpu, ram, storage
b) Openness - how system sees itself
c) Concurrency - system is able to do multiple tasks
d) Scalability - systems can allocate resources and add nodes
e) Fault tolerance - system stays online even with faults
f) Transparency - what parts of server are available

Q5:
A. Blockchain (Distributed Ledgers)
nodes access the chain and the blocks are distributed so that each member has to agree when the chain is altered

Q6:
Scenario D
its location, failure, replication, and mobility Transparency
resources can be on any network
resources dont have to come from one source
resources dont show failure when one part goes down
resources dont have to stay in one place
