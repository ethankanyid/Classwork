Q1: if the client time is off, then the buffer will be off and the loading will be out of sync

Q2: the manifest file holds the information for where the server is, what it has, and what quality it is

Q3: it distributes the content to multiple servers across locations so that instead of one huge central fail point, there are localized access

Q4: C

Socket questions

Q1: ❯ python3 client.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ethankanyid/portfolio/code/455/client.py", line 7, in <module>
    s.connect(("127.0.0.1", port))
    ~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61] Connection refused

Q2: 5 connections can be made

Q3: the first to arrive would be accepted and the second would be refused

Q4: 127.0.0.1 uses a loopback interface which is present on almost all computers - therefore the connection never leaves your system. using your ip requires a connection out to the router and loopback

Q5: client and server must use the same port because the other ports are for different services and the connection will likely be refused.

Q6: tcp is used because it is a reliable connection dedicated to this conversation
