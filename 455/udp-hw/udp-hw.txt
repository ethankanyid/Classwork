Q1: the fields are
source port
destination port
length
checksum

Q2: the sizes are
source port: 2 bytes
destination port: 2 bytes
length: 2 bytes
checksum: 2 bytes

Q3:
the length in the packet field is 177. this is the length of the header plus the data
the headers add up to 8 and the data is 173 bytes

Q4:
the max size of a udp packet is 65535 bytes, so you subtract the 8 bytes for the header which equals 65527 bytes

Q5:
a port is 2 bytes which is 16 bits so 2^16 - 1 = 65,535
the highest port is 65,535

Q6:
the protocol number for udp is 17 or 0x11

Q7:
the source port of the sender is the destination port of the receiver
and when the receiver responds, the destination port is the same as its previous souce port
and the source port is the same as the previous destination port
