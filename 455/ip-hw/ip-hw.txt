1. 192.168.1.101 (used the provided zip)
2. icmp (1)
3. header was 20 bytes, payload was 64 bytes, the payload bytes is the bytes of the data section
4. the datagram was not fragmented, but on mac the datagrams are fragmented as ipv4 and udp packet
5. the fields that change are identification, time to live, and checksum
6. the source and destination are constant, as wel as the payload, header length, and flags
- this is because the packets arent changing, just how far they can make it, and its sequence so it can all be tracked
7. the identification is changing by 1
8. there were three packets from the router with incrementing identification and 255 for TTL,
9. the TTL is all the same because they are just trying to respond to the source
10. yes the packet was fragmented there was a frame 175 and 176
11. the more fragments set indicates that this datagram is a fragment and that it is reassembled in frame 176
the datagram is 1480 bytes and its the first one because the stream index is one
12. there are no more fragments because the more fragment bit is not set. you can also see its not the first fragment because of the offset
13. total length, checksum, offset, bytes, more fragments
14. it made 3 fragments
15  total length, checksum, offset, bytes, more fragments
