### `CPTS_322/` â€“ Software Engineering

This folder contains all of my assignments, classwork, and projects from **CPTS 322 at WSU**, which focused on **software engineering** principles and practices. The course provided an in-depth understanding of the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Key topics included **software design patterns**, **agile development**, **version control** with **Git**, **unit testing**, and **software project management**. Additionally, the course emphasized best practices for **collaborative development**, **code reviews**, and **documentation**.

One of the major projects involved developing a **Turing machine** simulation in **C++**, which required creating UML diagrams for system design and performing extensive testing to ensure the functionality of the machine. This project provided hands-on experience with both **object-oriented design** and **formal computation**.
