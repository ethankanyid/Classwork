### `CPTS_223/` â€“ Advanced Data Structures

This folder contains all of my assignments, labs, and projects from **CPTS 223 at WSU**, which focused on **advanced data structures**. In this course, I learned about complex data structures such as **heaps**, **hash tables**, **graphs**, and **balanced trees**. The course expanded on the basics of data structures, focusing on more sophisticated and efficient ways to store and manipulate data for solving real-world problems.
