### `CPTS_327/` â€“ Cybersecurity & Cryptography

This folder contains all of my assignments, classwork, and projects from **CPTS 327 at WSU**, which focused on **cybersecurity** and **cryptography**. The course covered a wide range of topics in securing systems, protecting data, and understanding cryptographic protocols.

Key topics included **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**, **hash functions**, **digital signatures**, **public key infrastructure (PKI)**, and **cryptographic vulnerabilities** such as **buffer overflows**, **SQL injection**, and **cross-site scripting (XSS)**. The course also introduced **quantum cryptography**, with a focus on concepts like **entanglement** and **superposition**, applied to protocols such as **BB84** and **E91**.

In this class, I also became CompTIA Security+ certified.
