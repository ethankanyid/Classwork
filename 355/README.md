### `CPTS_355/` â€“ Programming Language Design & Development

This folder contains all of my assignments, classwork, and projects from **CPTS 355 at WSU**, which focused on **programming language design** and **development**. The course explored the theory behind designing programming languages, as well as the practical implementation of language features and compilers.

Key topics included **syntax and semantics**, **formal grammar**, **lexical analysis**, **parsing techniques**, and **interpreters**. Additionally, the course covered the design of control structures, data types, and memory management in the context of a new language.

The course also introduced **functional programming** through **Lisp** and **Standard ML**, emphasizing **recursion**, **immutability**, and **higher-order functions**. This provided a deeper understanding of how functional languages handle computation and the importance of functional paradigms in modern language design.
