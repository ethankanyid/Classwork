### `CPTS_360/` â€“ Operating Systems

This folder contains all of my assignments, labs, and projects from **CPTS 360 at WSU**, which focused on **operating systems**. The course provided an in-depth understanding of how operating systems manage hardware, resources, and software. Key topics included **process management**, **synchronization**, **memory management**, and **file systems**.

Throughout the course, I worked on projects that involved writing code to simulate operating system components, such as **scheduling algorithms**, **deadlock detection**, and **memory allocation**. These assignments helped me understand the inner workings of operating systems and gain experience in **system-level programming**.
